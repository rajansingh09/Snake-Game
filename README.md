# 🐍 Snake Game – JavaScript Edition

This is a simple yet fun **Snake Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game replicates the classic snake experience, where the player controls a growing snake that must eat food to grow longer and avoid crashing into walls or itself.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The snake is drawn using a grid-based coordinate system.
2. Arrow key presses are captured to change the snake's direction.
